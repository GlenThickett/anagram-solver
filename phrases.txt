a blessing in disguise
a dime a dozen
a drop in the bucket
a fish out of water
a fool and his money are soon parted
a friend in need is a friend indeed
a house divided cannot stand
a picture is worth a thousand words
a piece of cake
a stitch in time saves nine
a watched pot never boils
actions speak louder than words
add fuel to the fire
against all odds
all bark and no bite
all that glitters is not gold
all good things must come to an end
all in good time
all in the same boat
an apple a day keeps the doctor away
another day another dollar
as good as gold
as luck would have it
as right as rain
at the drop of a hat
back to square one
back to the drawing board
ball is in your court
beat around the bush
beat the clock
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
beggars cant be choosers
better late than never
better safe than sorry
better the devil you know
bite off more than you can chew
bite the bullet
bite the hand that feeds you
blood is thicker than water
break the ice
burn the midnight oil
burning the candle at both ends
burst your bubble
by the book
call it a day
cant judge a book by its cover
charity begins at home
chew the fat
chip on your shoulder
clean slate
close but no cigar
cold shoulder
come rain or shine
crack of dawn
cross that bridge when you come to it
cry over spilled milk
curiosity killed the cat
cut to the chase
dont bite off more than you can chew
dont count your chickens before they hatch
dont judge a book by its cover
down to earth
easier said than done
every cloud has a silver lining
every dog has its day
face the music
fair and square
fall on deaf ears
feast or famine
fight fire with fire
find your feet
for crying out loud
from rags to riches
get a grip
get out of hand
get the ball rolling
go the extra mile
go with the flow
good things come to those who wait
hard pill to swallow
have a heart
heart of gold
heard it through the grapevine
hit the nail on the head
hit the road
hold your horses
in a nutshell
in hot water
in the blink of an eye
in the nick of time
its not rocket science
jump on the bandwagon
keep your chin up
kick the bucket
kill two birds with one stone
last but not least
learn the rope
let sleeping dogs lie
let the cat out of the bag
light at the end of the tunnel
lions share
live and let live
look before you leap
lose your touch
make a long story short
method to the madness
miss the boat
money doesnt grow on trees
needle in a haystack
no pain no gain
off the hook
once in a blue moon
on thin ice
on top of the world
out of the blue
piece of cake
play it by ear
practice makes perfect
pull yourself together
raining cats and dogs
read between the lines
rise and shine
rule of thumb
safe and sound
second wind
seeing is believing
sleep on it
speak of the devil
spill the beans
steal your thunder
take a rain check
take it with a grain of salt
the best of both worlds
the calm before the storm
the early bird catches the worm
the pot calling the kettle black
the sky is the limit
the straw that broke the camels back
the whole nine yards
there is no place like home
third times the charm
time flies when you are having fun
time is money
tip of the iceberg
to make matters worse
two heads are better than one
under the weather
up in the air
walk the talk
when it rains it pours
you cant please everyone
you reap what you sow
your guess is as good as mine
