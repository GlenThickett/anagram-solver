    <h2>1. Look for common prefixes and suffixes</h2>
    <p>
        Many English words share familiar endings like <strong>-ing</strong>, <strong>-ed</strong>,
        <strong>-tion</strong>, <strong>-ment</strong>, and <strong>-ly</strong>.
        Try grouping letters to see if any of these patterns emerge.

    <h2>2. Identify vowels first</h2>
    <p>
        Vowels give structure to words. Count how many vowels you have and try placing them
        in likely positions. A long word with only one vowel greatly narrows the possibilities.

    <h2>3. Rearrange physically</h2>
    <p>
        Writing letters on paper or tiles and physically moving them around can reveal patterns
        your brain may miss when looking at a fixed string of letters.

<section>
    <h2>4. Think about word meaning and context</h2>
    <p>
        In crosswords, the clue definition often gives strong hints about the answer’s meaning,
        tense, or part of speech. Use that information to guide your rearranging.

    <h2>5. Break longer anagrams into chunks</h2>
    <p>
        For longer anagrams, try splitting the letters into smaller groups and solving each part
        independently, then recombining them.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>6. Practice common letter patterns</h2>
    <p>
        Experienced solvers recognize common letter groupings instantly. The more puzzles you
        solve, the faster these patterns become automatic.
